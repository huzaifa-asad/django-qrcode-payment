## Project structure

```python
djangoqr/
  manage.py
  requirements.txt
  core/                # Base pages, global styles
  scanner/             # Generate and Scan features
  djangoqr/            # Project settings and URLs
  media/               # Generated QR images (dev)
```

## Quick start

1. Clone and enter the project folder
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
3. Run database migrations
4. Start the dev server

```bash
# 1) clone
git clone <your-repo-url>.git
cd djangoqr

# 2) venv + install
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) migrate
python manage.py migrate

# 4) run
python manage.py runserver
```

## Environment

- Development static files are served by Django with `DEBUG=True`.
- Generated QR images are written under `media/qr_codes/`. The `media/` folder is ignored in git.

## Settings notes

- STATIC_URL is configured as `/static/`.
- Templates use `{% load static %}` and `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'core/css/style.css' %}?v=2025-09-14">`.
- You can remove the `?v=...` query once you use hashed static files in production.

## Production tips

- Use `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` for cache-busted static assets.
- Serve static files via a web server or CDN (e.g., Nginx).
- Set `DEBUG=False` and configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
- Configure a proper database (PostgreSQL, etc.).
- Store secrets via environment variables.
